AMR Tracking System
üöÄ Overview
This project is an Anti-Microbial Resistance (AMR) Tracking System designed to monitor and visualize trends in antibiotic resistance data. My goal is to provide healthcare professionals and researchers with an intuitive tool for data analysis and reporting, aiding in the fight against antimicrobial resistance.

‚ú® Features
Data Input: Allows for manual input and management of microbial resistance data points.

Interactive Data Visualization: Displays AMR trends and patterns using dynamic charts and graphs (e.g., bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps).

Filtering & Analysis: Enables users to filter data by antibiotic type, region, time period, and other relevant parameters for deeper insights.

Responsive User Interface: Optimized for seamless access and usability across various devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

[Add any other specific features unique to your AMR project, e.g., "User authentication," "Exportable reports"].
